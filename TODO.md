Check Derivation of AP
======================

The AP results seem to differ from ours by a factor of two. We should look at

Make Function Arguments more Intuitive and Consistent
=====================================================

I feel like many of the functions have differing argument structures. They should be modified to have a more intuitive structure. Also, some functions which are similar or in same module have very different argument structure. This could be confusing for users. - Logan

Make Function Documentations
============================

Not all functions have documentation. - Logan
