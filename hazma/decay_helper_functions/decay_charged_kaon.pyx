"""
Module for computing the photon spectrum from radiative kaon decay.

Description:
    The charged kaon has many decay modes:

        k -> mu  + nu
        k -> pi  + pi0
        k -> pi  + pi  + pi
        k -> pi0 + e   + nu
        k -> pi0 + mu  + nu
        k -> pi  + pi0 + pi0

    For the the two-body final states, the sum of the decay spectra are
    computed given the known energies of the final state particles in the
    kaon's rest frame. The spectrum is then boosted into the lab frame.

    For the three-body final state, the energies of the final state
    particles are computed using RAMBO. The spectra for each final state
    particle is computed are each point in phases space in the charged kaon's rest frame and then spectra are summed over. The spectra is then boosted into the lab frame.
